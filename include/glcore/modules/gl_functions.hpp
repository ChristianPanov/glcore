 * @brief Loads OpenGL functions.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2023-04-28
 *
 * @details One of the main philosophies of GLCore is to be as lightweight as possible. This means that
 * we *do not* provide an OpenGL loader, instead, we provide a placeholder header file that you can
 * modify according to your own needs!
 *
 * In order to do so, just substitute the include directive below with your own OpenGL loader
 * (GLAD, GLEW, etc...).
 *
 * @note the placeholder header file is just to prevent errors from showing up on your IDE. It does
 * nothing and once you replace it with your own loader, you can delete it if you want.
